This application was made to look similar to a simple web store with a searchbar, 
filter bar, and checkout page. I used the useContext hook to be able to pass data 
without the use of prop drilling or push the state up which can get messy with bigger 
projects. I also came to use an external databse, MongoDB, to store some data I made so 
the application can request and use the information to display on screen. 
A checkout page was created to simply pass the information of the cart, display it,
add the total for the items and added a pay button just for display.
